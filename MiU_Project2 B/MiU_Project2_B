Instead of displaying the data at the bottom of the main menu. I feel that it may be better for the user to view their data in a new window. It is less clutter, and easier to read their list of tasks. Instead of scrolling to the bottom of the main menu, the user can click two buttons, and their saved data is displayed. They are also able to go back to the main screen by selecting the "Home" button.
